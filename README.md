# BiM Film Directory Archive

## Brief

[Bricks in Motion](http://www.bricksinmotion.com/) is a friendly filmmaking community devoted to the art of stop-motion animation. [Since 2009](http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/post/45237/), BiM has kept a film directory where brickfilm animators can submit their films. After running for nearly 10 years, the directory had become a logical mess and a nightmare to maintain and bug fix, yet remained popular and used daily.

As part of a larger forum upgrade, the directory become incompatible on a technical level, but the submitted films needed to be preserved for posterity purposes.

The purpose of this project is to provide a modern browsing experience for the directory while using the original database structure, making only slight improvements when necessary.
